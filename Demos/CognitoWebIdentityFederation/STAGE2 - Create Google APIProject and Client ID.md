# Advanced Demo - Web Identity Federation

# STAGE 2A - Create Google API PROJECT  

Any application that uses OAuth 2.0 to access Google APIs must have authorization credentials that identify the application to Google's OAuth 2.0 server.  
In this stage we need to create those authorization credentials.  

You will need a valid google login, GMAIL will do.  
If you don't have one, you will need to create one as part of this process.  
Move to the Google Credentials page https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials    
Either sign in, or create a Google account  

You will be moved to the `Google API Console`    
You may have to set your country and agree to some terms and conditions, thats fine go ahead and do that.    
Click the `Select a project` dropdown, and then click `NEW PROJECT`   
For project name enter `PetIDF`  
Click `Create`    

# STAGE 2B - Configure Consent Screen  

Click `Credentials`  
Click `CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN`    
because our application will be usable by any google user, we have to select external users  
Check the box next to `External` and click `CREATE`  
Next you need to give the application a name ... enter `PetIDF` in the `App Name` box.   
enter your own email in `user support email`  
enter your own email in `Developer contact information`  
Click `SAVE AND CONTINUE`   
Click `SAVE AND CONTINUE`  
Click `SAVE AND CONTINUE`  
Click `BACK TO DASHBOARD`    


# STAGE 2C - Create Google API PROJECT CREDENTIALS  

Click `Credentials` on the menu on the left   
Click `CREATE CREDENTIALS` and then `OAuth client ID`   
In the `Application type download` select `Web Application`   
Under Name enter `PetIDFServerlessApp`  

We need to add the S3 bucket URL, this is the Static Website Hosting Endpoints you noted down earlier.   
Click `ADD URI` under `Authorized JavaScript origins`   
Enter the endpoint URL, it should look something like this `http://webidf-appbucket-jnxw37ll2eib.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/` but you NEED to use your own.   
Click `CREATE`  

You will be presented with two pieces of information  

- `Client ID`  
- `Client Secret`  

Note them both down, using the copy button, store them somewhere safe you will need them soon.  
Once they are noted down safely, click `OK`   

# STAGE 2 - FINISH  

- Template front end app bucket
