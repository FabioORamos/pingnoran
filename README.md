# aws-sa-pro
In the Demos folder, you will find the documentation and files used in each demo. Those demos were extracted from the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional by Adrian Cantrill. In most instances I've adapted the templates to run from the ap-southeast-2 region.

# study-notes
The study notes folder contains information on the courses I've taken so far. It is by no means a comprehensive list, but rather topics that I've considered important.

Feel free to use any of those resources! :octocat:
